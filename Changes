    * A provider that pulls credentials from the instance metadata server has
      been added.
    * Credential refresh has been implemented for the environment and instance
      metadata credential providers.
    * COMPATIBILITY BREAKING: This probably won't break many, if any, callers,
      but it conceivable could. AWS::Credentials has been converted to a role
      and the punned class is used when non-refreshable credentials are
      returned.  This mades implementing refreshable credentials easier because
      attributes cannot be inherited.
    * More tests have been added. Previously, very, very little was actually
      tested.
    * Uses Perl built-ins for formatting and parsing W3C dates rather than the
      now no longer maintained DateTime::Format::W3CDTF.
